# HR-Tableau-Project

This project showcases an end-to-end analysis of HR data using Tableau. The goal is to provide insightful visualizations and dashboards for human resources metrics, including employee performance, attrition rates, hiring trends, and workforce demographics. This HR Dashboard uses a dataset generated using **ChatGPT** & **Faker** library.

## Key Features:
* Data Visualization: Leveraging Tableau to create interactive dashboards that highlight key HR insights, such as employee turnover, satisfaction levels, and recruitment efficiency.
* Key Metrics: performance distribution, salary comparison, and employee satisfaction by department.
* Dashboard Presentation: Designed for ease of use by HR professionals, allowing for quick decision-making based on visual data.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout the completion of this project, I gained valuable insights and skills, including:
* Dashboard Design: The project helped me understand how to design dashboards with end-users in mind, focusing on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use for HR professionals who rely on quick and actionable insights.
* Forecasting and Predictive Analysis: I learned how to use Tableauâ€™s forecasting tools to predict future trends, particularly employee turnover. This demonstrated the power of data-driven prediction in supporting strategic decisions.
* Tableau Proficiency: I significantly improved my ability to create interactive and insightful dashboards in Tableau, focusing on human resource analytics. This included working with various chart types, calculated fields, and filters to present complex data in an understandable format.
